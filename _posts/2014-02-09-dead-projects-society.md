Here is a list of some projects that I have done by the past.

Most of them aren't finished, and I may have lost many source files, but well here they are anyway.

I'm publishing them because from time to time  I receive an e-mail requesting details about them.

## FPGA designs

- Micronique *Hector HRX* core running on Spartan-3 Starter Board by Digilent.

- *Oric-1 / Oric Atmos* core. I have a version running on the S3 board seen above, but also on a Terasic DE1 board with a partial *Microdisc* emulation.

- *Thomson MO5* core.

## Hardware hacks

*TODO*
