Here is a list of some projects that I have done by the past.

Most of them aren't finished, and I may have lost many source files, but well here they are anyway.

I'm publishing them because from time to time  I receive an e-mail requesting details about them.

## FPGA designs

- *Micronique Hector HRX* core running on Spartan-3 Starter Board by Digilent.

- *Oric-1 / Oric Atmos* core. I have a version running on the S3 board mentioned above, but also on a Terasic DE1 board with a partial *Microdisc* emulation.

- *Thomson MO5* core.

## Hardware hacks

- *Guimauve 2ooo* is a VGA adapter for the Apple //c and //c+ computers. That silly name comes from the *Chat Mauve* board that did the same for RGB SCART interface.

- *Cocoleco* is a multi-game cartridge for the *Colecovision*. It features a menu for game selection. 

- *usbSID* enables you to connect a *Commodore 64 SID* to your PC through USB. The idea was to be able to hear the famous chiptunes of this era on the real hardware.

- *Exelvision EXL-100* dump of the *TMS 7041* internal ROM. This was a bit tricky ot set up, but it worked.

- *RGB SCART* output for the *Videopac* series of videogame consoles.

## Software

- I've added the *Minitel 2* emulation to *MESS*. That sounds silly at a first glance... The idea was to ease the development of a demo based of the work that *Jeff* did.

- I've written some code in assembly or C for the *Game Boy Advance*, the *Neo Geo Pocket Color*, and some other machines as well.

- I've been playing with the *Forth* programming language, and wrote an *ARM* ANS-Forth flavor of it for *Game Boy Advance* and *Nintendo DS*.
