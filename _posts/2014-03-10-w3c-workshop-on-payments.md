A *W3C Workshop on Payments* will be held in Paris, on the 24-25 March 2014.

I've had the opportunity to write a *Position Paper* on the subject, as the company I work for is specialized in payments in general.

Today, I learned that my paper has been accepted, which means that I will attend and participate to this workshop!

I'm pretty glad it has been selected, as it is the first time I'm doing this kind of submission, and that the list of attendees is quite large.
There have been more candidates than available seats, so I'm pretty excited to have the opportunity to attend such an event.

You can read my *Position Paper* [here](http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/papers/webpayments2014_submission_15.pdf). It is also available on my GitHub repositories.
