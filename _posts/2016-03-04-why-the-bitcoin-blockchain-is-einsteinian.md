# Over the top

As of today, the blockchain is a hot topic. According to many people and institutions, including banks (who were among the first to disregard the Bitcoin phenomenon) it looks like a revolution in both the computer science and the the economics fields.

The 9-pages long [Bitcoin paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) (mis)interpretation seems to be an infinite source of "brilliant" ideas and articles (including this one, obviously).

That said, I couldn't resist the urge of raising the bar a little bit, by sharing what my years-long interest and experience in this field finally taught me.

Let's put an end to this unbearable suspense: **The Bitcoin blockchain is an Einsteinian solution to a Newtonian problem.**

# Distributed ledger issues

Bitcoin, as any financial system, needs a ledger. This distibuted ledger guarantees the transfer of ownership of a given "coin", by the use of cryptograhic signatures from both the current and the future owner.

Fair enough. Now enters the issue of *double-spending*. In a distributed system, one malicious attacker could spread many  transfer-of-ownership transactions issued from the very same coin.

Now let's forget for a while what we already know about Bitcoin and its blockchain. If the ledger was held by a single, central authority, then this issue wouldn't exist. The first transfer-of-ownership would be written into the ledger, and the subsequent ones would be refused.

The idea of **first** and **subsequent** transfer-of-ownership transactions rely on the idea of **time**. Even with Einstein's (and others) works on Relativity, we still live with the idea of time perceived as an absolute, regular, infinite phenomenon.

Our world may be **Einsteinian**, but our perception of it is **Newtonian**.

# Open your book at chapter three...

Chapter #3 of [Bitcoin paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) is entitled **Timestamp server**.

Its first sentence is:

> The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server.

There comes the idea of [Trusted Timestamping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping). The idea isn't new, and has been successfully used in many fields such as law or finance, in order to give documents a probative value.

However, giving trust to some external entity, being it only for applying a timestamp to a given document, is against Bitcoin's philosophy.

And what is the proposed solution? Yes, you already know it: the (in)famous **proof-of-work**.

The **proof-of-work** is the idea of finding a solution to a given problem of cryptographic computation, that cannot (as of today's knowledge) be solved in a reasonable amount of time by brute force, or even a **predictable amount of time**.

Think about it as a **giant lottery**.

# Why does it matter?

Now, let's go further: **no matter how many attempts, how much time** is spent by computers all around the world to find a solution, the idea of a **continuous flow of time** is dictacted by a chain of "lucky ones" solving the problem.

No matter how much **real world's time** is spent trying (or not) to find a solution, it is only when such a solution is eventually found that the **blockchain's time** "advances" (i.e. a new block of transactions is added to the blockchain). This is the **energy** spent to find the **correct solution**, the **proof-of-work** that rules the world.

That's right. **In Bitcoin's universe, Time has been replaced by Energy.**

But what is really disturbing is that, since Einstein, we all know that **it is how the real world works.**

This is what seems to me where the real genius of the Bitcoin's blockchain resides: instead of trying to find a way to replace the need of an absolute timestmap server, which is something that **belongs to a Newtonian perception of the world**, it just goes further by finding a solution in **Einstein's spacetime model**.

And it works!   

# From Einstein to Newton... wait, what?

And as the Bitcoin universe expands (to a limit), the problem to solve increases in difficulty, adapting itself to the whole computing power of its members.

This is where another part of the "magic" resides: for most problems in computer science, the **time** spent to solve them decreases (Moore's law et al.), whereas in Bitcoin's blockchain case, it seems steady...

> Total Bitcoins over time

And this is where the paradox relies: Bitcoin uses an **Einsteinian, energy-based, spacetime** timestamping scheme to enforce what looks like a **Newtonian, continuous flow of time**.

Mind. Blown.
